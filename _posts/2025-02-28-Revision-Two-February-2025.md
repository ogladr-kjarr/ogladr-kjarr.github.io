# Computing

## Helsinki Python Programming MOOC2023
**22 Hours**

This was a fun course, very good for a beginner to both programming and Python, and the model answers provided once you submitted a working solution to a question were nice examples of succinct ways of approaching the question. 

Having not programmed in a long time it was a nice re-introduction. Though most of the exercises weren't challenging, it was good practice to aid my memory. It was also my first time using typed Python, which I think is a good thing and will definitly use in the future.

## MIT OpenCourseWare 6.001L
**20 Hours**

This is another good introduction to programming. Unlike the Helsinki MOOC which introduced programming through multiple repeated excercises to drill in the concepts, this was more theoretical. There were programming assignments, and unit tests to help know if you solved an assigment correctly. There was a bit of hassle as the Python version I was using had deprecated one of the functions in the unit tests, but using UV to install an older version of Python in a environement for the course meant they worked fine.

I preferred the MOOC path overall. The main difference in content is that this course had lectures on theory regarding computational complexity and algorithms.
