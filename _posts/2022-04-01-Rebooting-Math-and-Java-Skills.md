# Introduction

Having last studied mathematics in 1998, I have felt the lack of further study in the subject has held me back from software projects I wanted to take part in, such as to do with Particle Filters and Algorithm Design.  I have seen colleagues working on projects that were of interest and that I would have liked to have been able to contribute to, but I did not have the skills necessary. I've decided it's as good a time as any to rectify this lack of knowledge and start on a path of self-teaching myself mathematics.

Similarly, having taken a multi-year break from programming, and with my most recent experience being in R and Python, I have decided to learn Java. The last time I programmed in Java was 2002, the year my university changed the language of choice for non-specialised classes to C#. This is a pragmatic choice based on the jobs market for the language.

# Plan

**Maths** 

The plan is to make use of the vast amount of free textbooks available on-line to reach my goal of achieving the level of a first-year undergraduate mathematics student, before re-assessing to focus on the subjects necessary to work on the projects I wish to contribute to.  Initially I hope to spend around ten hours a week on this project, though this amount may change over time.  I have no time-specific goals for this project as I have no idea of how long it will take to learn the subjects I wish to study.

Currently the initial topics I plan on starting with are *Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry*, followed by *Calculus*, then *Proof* based topics.  Once I am confident in these I will find an undergraduate course guide and follow as best I can with the free resources available.

**Java**

The plan is to pick up some second hand textbooks covering the basics, and augmenting them with a batch of O'Reilly books that came up in a Humble Bundle that I purchased a year or two ago but haven't looked at yet. Similar to the plan for maths, I intend to spend around ten hours a week on this task. I hope to have the basics done within a few months, and to start contributing to open source projects within six to twelve months.

# Outcome

It is my hope that at the end of this I will be able to: contribute to open source projects, follow and implement computer science research papers from *arXiv*, and most optimistically, find work utilizing my new skill set.
