# The Odin Project: Intermediate HTML and CSS Course

I have slowly been making my way through the course, going from 39% to 69%. I am at the sign-up screen project and will be tackling it in the week to come. It has been a theory heavy week, with no small projects to break up the content and put it to use. I think the course could do with one or two more projects in this section.

# Books

**Intermediate Algebra - OpenStax**

I have completed this book. It was an interesting read, challenging in some areas and definitely not just refreshing material. There were many sections where I had no memory of having tackled those types of problems before.

# Next Steps

I plan on finishing the Intermediate HTML and CSS course on The Odin Project. I will also start the next algebra book I have lined up, that is OpenStax College Algebra. My plan is to finish the following OpenStax books in succession before starting on calculus: College Algebra, Algebra and Trigonometry, PreCalculus.
