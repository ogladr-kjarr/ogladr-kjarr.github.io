## Trigonometry: Katherine Yoshiwara
**Hours**

Glad I worked through the geometry book before this one, as the first chapter was helped by it.
Also there are links from the answers in the appendix back to the question which was nice, though two way links would be better. 
A good book so far, some formatting erros where the latex commands are shown rather than the characters they encode. and some mistakes in the teaching text like on page 93 for sin(180-80), and mistakes in the answers to some questions that I'm convinced I have right.

It isn't as nice and polished as the OpenStax offerings, but it does have much more content on the subject.

The question sections can be very challenging, much more so than OpenStax who go slow and have examples of every different type of question they'll ask. This made me think more, but it also stumped me more too on some questions, some with no answers.
