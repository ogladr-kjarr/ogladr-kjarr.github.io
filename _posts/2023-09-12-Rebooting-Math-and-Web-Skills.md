# Introduction

Having last studied mathematics in 1998, and last doing any web development in 2008, I have let these skills lapse.  This lack has stopped me being a candidate for jobs I would enjoy and like to be considered for.  I have seen colleagues working on projects that were of interest to me and that I would have liked to have been able to contribute to, but I did not have the skills necessary.  I've decided it's as good a time as any to rectify this lack of knowledge and start on a path of self-teaching myself mathematics and web development.

Having taken a multi-year break from programming, and with my most recent experience being in R and Python, I have decided to aim to learn Javascript, and once I feel confident in that I will decide upon a backend language, if that is different from Javascript.

# Plan

**Maths** 

The plan is to make use of the vast amount of free textbooks available on-line to reach my goal of achieving the level of a first-year undergraduate mathematics student.  Initially I hope to spend around ten hours a week on this project, though this amount may change over time.  I have no time-specific goals for this project as I have no idea of how long it will take to learn the subjects I wish to study.

Currently the initial topics I plan on starting with are *Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry*, followed by *Calculus*, then *Discrete Maths* based topics.  Once I am confident in these I will find an undergraduate course guide and follow as best I can with the free resources available.

**Web Development**

The plan is to use freely available learning resources, primarily *The Odin Project* and *Free Code Camp* resources, as well as *Full Stack Open*. Once these have been completed there is a wealth of free tutorials and guides on YouTube to use. I also aim to spend around ten hours a week on this project.  It is my aim that after a year I will be able to create some projects I have in mind such as time recording, archaeological data exploring, and a parking data map explorer.

# Outcome

It is my hope that within a year I will be at a level where I will feel confident enough in my skills to apply for development jobs.
