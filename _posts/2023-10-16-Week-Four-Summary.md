Week four was delayed due to a week's break I took from studying.

# The Odin Project: Foundations

I went from 64% complete to 91% complete. The foundations course is nearly finished, with two projects and one lesson left. The rock-paper-scissors assignment was the first Javascript project. It was straightforward, though I only made the most bare bones interface. So far I have enjoyed the course and the last two projects seem interesting.

# Web Tutorials

**Interneting Is Hard**

I finished the online tutorial and was very impressed by how much it covered and the clarity of the lessons.

# Books

**Elementary Algebra - OpenStax**

I finished this book. It was a good introduction to basic Algebra. Much of it was a refresh rather than learning for the first time.

**Intermediate Algebra - OpenStax**

I started this book, and have completed the first five chapters. There is overlap with the previous Algebra book, but there are also new parts that are interesting.

# Next Steps

In the next week I hope to finish The Odin Project Foundations course and complete the next three chapters of the Algebra book.
