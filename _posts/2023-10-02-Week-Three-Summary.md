# The Odin Project: Foundations

I went from 56% complete to 64% complete.

The project at the end of the flexbox section was extrememly satisfying. When I first read what I had to do (create a landing page), I was a little intimidated, but putting the HTML together followed by the CSS piece by piece the page came into shape and I am happy that I was able to achieve it. I am now at the start of the JavaScript section.

# Web Tutorials

**Interneting Is Hard**

Following the link from TOP to the [Interneting Is Hard](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/) page on Flexbox, I decided to go through the course and so far it has been a well designed and very informative one. The basics I'd already covered but it was good to get another view on them. The section on floats was excellent and I understand them much more now. 

I still have to go through the last six lessons.

# Books

**Elementary Algebra - OpenStax**

This week took longer progressing through the latter chapters as I needed to spend time on the practise exercises to make sure I really grasped the content. I only have two chapters to finish.

# Next Steps

In the next week I will finish the Elementary Algebra book, and I will start the JavaScript section of TOP fundamentals course. However one of the links in the first lesson on JavaScript is to [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/), and I think I may try and tackle the whole fundamentals section and the other sections from that site before progressing with TOP.
