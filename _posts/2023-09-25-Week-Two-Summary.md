At the end of the second week I feel like I know and understand the HTML side of things, and know a little of the CSS side of things. The Dave Gray video on CSS was very thorough, and though many parts were more advanced than TOP level I'm currently at, it was definitly worth watching to know what is possible. 

I need to do more work to fully understand Flex and Grid layouts.

# Videos

**CSS Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners - FreeCodeCamp.org Dave Gray [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXGznpKZ_sA)**

This was an eleven hour course on CSS covering what I assume to be all major CSS subjects. Some was known to me, some not, but generally I felt everything had enough time and explanation to it.  It would be better if there were mini projects to do for each chapter of the video, as that would have helped to really get to grips with the chapters contents, building up to the final project.

It took three days to work through this video, and while it's not possible to remember everything, I now know the outlines of different CSS selectors and attributes so I hopefully know what to search for when looking for answers. For layouts I'll be sure to try and practise with Flexbox Froggy and CSS Grid Garden, and generally to start using the Mozilla Developer Network for looking up information as suggested by the video.


# The Odin Project: Foundations

I went from 47% complete to 56% complete.
 
They provided a link for [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/). This looks like a great resource to go over the basics already picked up, and to dive into the more techinical aspects of display layout, responsive design, and typeography. Also the [Learn Layout](https://learnlayout.com/) link was provided, another useful link. So far the only part I'm not finding straightforward is understanding layouts, however the next TOP section in foundations is on the Flexbox technique, so I hope this helps.

# Books

**Elementary Algebra - OpenStax**

I've completed another two chapters. It is my aim to finish this textbook within the next two weeks. So far the contents have been a refresher, and I have managed to pass the practise tests at the end of each chapter without working through the section's examples.

# Next Steps

I'm going to focus on all the links and TOP lessons on layout when it comes to the web side of things, and to finish most of the elementary algebra book.
