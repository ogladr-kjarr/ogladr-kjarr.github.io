## Algebra and Trigonometry: OpenStax
**43 Hours**

This was an extremely comprehensive book, covering the same material barring a few sub-sections as the Pre-Calculus book also by OpenStax. It explained most things well, with a wealth of questions and answers to really practise and learn the material. It took a number of months working part-time to get through it, and so some of the earlier material has been forgotten unfortunately. However as all the topics are self contained and well organised, I feel this will make an excellent reference book for when I'm going through the calculus material.

The only area I found difficult to understand following their teaching was Partial Fractions. While I understood the examples and could work through them, I found their formal definition to be unintelligible to my mind.

## Pre-Calculus: OpenStax
**4 Hours**

There were two sub-sections that were in this textbook that were not in the Algebra and Trigonometry book, and a chapeter introducing calculus. I worked through these, happily knowing that I'd already covered all the rest of the material. I'm looking forward to when I start calculus.
