# Introduction

Having last studied mathematics in 1998, I have felt the lack of further study in the subject has held me back from software projects I wanted to take part in, such as to do with Particle Filters, Bayesian Statistics, and Algorithm Design.  I have seen colleagues working on projects that were of interest and that I would have liked to have been able to contribute to, but I did not have the skills necessary.

I've decided it's as good a time as any to rectify this lack of knowledge and start on a path of self-teaching myself Mathematics.

# Plan

The plan is to make use of the vast amount of free textbooks available on-line to reach my goal of achieving the level of a first-year undergraduate Mathematics student, before re-assessing to focus on the subjects necessary to work on the projects I wish to contribute to.  Initially I hope to spend around twenty hours a week on this project, though this amount may change over time.  I have no time-specific goals for this project as I have no idea of how long it will take to learn the subjects I wish to study, however I'll take a wild guess and say I anticipate it taking two to three years.

Currently the initial topics I plan on starting with are *Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry*, followed by *Calculus*, then *Proof* based topics.  Once I am confident in these I will find an undergraduate course guide and follow as best I can with the free resources available.

# Outcome

It is my hope that at the end of this I will be able to contribute to open source machine-learning projects, follow and implement math-heavy data science and computer science research papers from *arXiv*, and most optimistically, find work utilizing my new skill set.
