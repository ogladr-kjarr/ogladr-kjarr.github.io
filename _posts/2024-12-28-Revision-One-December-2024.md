# Maths

## Elementary Algebra: OpenStax
**16 Hours**

This was a gentle re-introduction to the basic topics of beginner mathematics. Instead of skipping this level, I went through the text and did most of the exercises to make sure that I wasn't missing any fundamental elements.

## Intermediate Algebra: OpenStax
**21 Hours**

This was the next book in the OpenStax Algebra catalogue. In this book there were a number of topics that were new to me; such as determinands, drawing graphs with transformations, and conics. This was an enjoyable book and even the parts that were revision rather than new learning were fun when working through the exercises.

## Geometry for Dummies: Mark Ryan
**6 Hours**

This book was the first time I had ever encountered proofs in mathematics. It was a challenging book due to trying to approaching proofs for the first time. It had good explanations on how to approach the proofs and had complete detailed answers. It would have been better if it had a lot more questions with answers though.

## Trigonometry for Dummies: Mary Jane Sterling
**11 Hours**

All I could remember before picking up this book about trigonometry was SOH-CAH-TOA. It is a well paced book, though it could have done with more exercises.
