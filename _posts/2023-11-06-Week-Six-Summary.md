# The Odin Project: Intermediate HTML and CSS Course

Having completed the Foundations course, I have started on the Javascript path. I have progressed 39% so far on the Intermediate HTML and CSS course.

It is still a very intersting and enjoyable course.

# Books

**Intermediate Algebra - OpenStax**

I completed chapters nine and ten, with only two more chapters until the end of the book.

# Next Steps

I plan to finish the Algebra book in the next week, and complete another 20% to 40% of the Intermediate HTML and CSS course.
