At the end of the first week I have completed a *Free Code Camp* video and a Kevil Powell playlist linked to by The Odin Project. I have started on *The Odin Project's* Foundations course and begun an Algebra textbook.

# Videos

**Learn HTML - Full Tutorial for Beginners (2022) - FreeCodeCamp.org Dave Gray [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE)**

This was a tutorial covering how to create web pages with only HTML. Of most interest were the parts on semantic HTML and the information on how to make web pages more accessible for those who cannot visually interact with a web page. The advice to not use <div></div> tags was surprising. He mentions that people used to use them a lot but now they're not used as much as they were, as they provide no semantic meaning. Overall it was a good introduction to HTML and common HTML tags, both block and inline, their attributes, and how to design a page using semantic tags to improve the accessibility. It has a good tutorial project at the end to recap what was covered.

**HTML & CSS for beginners (playlist) - Kevin Powell [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQuIIv2RVA&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjM0xE0K2uZRvsM7LkIhsPT-)**

Afer watching the FreeCodeCamp video by Dave Gray the first half of this playlist was much the same as that, however the videos on CSS and layouts were interesting. It too emphasised the use of tags for accessibility, such as using strong and em elements over b and i elements for semantic reasons. The box model was introduced and CSS pseudo classes, as well as basic CSS selectors. The only part that wasn't clear to me was the video on floats and clears. However he mentions that those techinques have been superceeded by other CSS techniques, so I'm not concerned about it at the moment.

# The Odin Project: Foundations

I started at the beginning of the foundation course and have made it through 47%. Even though some of the information is known to me from my computing background, I'm making a point of 100% completion of the course so I will not skip anything. The Git section could have benefited I think for introducing branches and stashing, though maybe this is convered later in the course.

Having completed the HTML section, the recipe project was much simpler than the one at the end of Dave Gray's learn HTML video mentioned above. Starting on the CSS section I like that they provide questions and challenges in code to work through, rather than just reading about the theory.

Overall I have enjoyed the course so far, and am looking forward to learning more in the second week. 
  
 
# Books

**Elementary Algebra - [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/details/books/elementary-algebra-2e)**

I'm starting from a book that is at the easy end of the spectrum for revising algebra. This is because I don't remember enough to know what I've forgotten. My plan is to skim through the sections and chapters that I feel comfortable with but to always do the practice tests at the chapters end to make sure I remember properly.

So far I have completed chapters one to three.

# Next Steps

Next week will be a short one due to outside commitments. I plan on completing another two chapters of the algebra textbook, and more of the CSS section.
