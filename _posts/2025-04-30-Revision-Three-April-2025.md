## Algebra and Trigonometry: OpenStax
**43 Hours**

This was an extremely comprehensive book, covering the same material barring a few sub-sections as the Pre-Calculus book also by OpenStax. It explained most things well, with a wealth of questions and answers to really practise and learn the material. It took a number of months working part-time to get through it, and so some of the earlier material has been forgotten unfortunately. However as all the topics are self contained and well organised, I feel this will make an excellent reference book for when I'm going through the calculus material.

The only area I found difficult to understand following their teaching was Partial Fractions. While I understood the examples and could work through them, I found their formal definition to be unintelligible.

## Pre-Calculus: OpenStax
**4 Hours**

There were two sub-sections that were in this textbook that were not in the Algebra and Trigonometry book, and a chapter introducing calculus. I worked through these, happily knowing that I'd already covered all the rest of the material. I'm looking forward to when I start calculus.

## PreCalculus: Stitz and Zeager
**45 Hours**

This was my favourite math textbook when I was early on in the text. It's not as simple as the OpenStax PreCalculus text, which has a lot more hand holding. I preferred the style of the book more, I felt concept explanation was better, and the number of exercises was as good as OpenStax. Also it felt more like a lecture, with much more textual explanations of things, rather than just example/question repeats.

However, towards the end I realised that I prefered the OpenStax offering. As it's less wordy it is good as a reference text to look up when revision is needed, and I found I missed the simple short expanations followed by multiple examples.

This book definitly went into more technical detail on absolute value inequalities, polynomial functions, and rational functions for example, as well as points on other subjects. The chapters related to trigonometry were excellent.

I ended up skipping most of the exercises as I had already worked at similar questions with the OpenStax books and was happy I understood the concepts.
