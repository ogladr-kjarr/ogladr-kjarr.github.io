# Introduction

Having last studied mathematics in 1998, and last doing any software development in 2018, I have let these skills lapse.  This lapse has stopped me being a candidate for jobs I believe I would enjoy and like to be considered for.  I have seen colleagues in the past working on projects that were of interest to me and that I would have liked to have been able to contribute to, but I did not have the skills necessary.  I've decided it's as good a time as any to rectify this lack of knowledge and start on a path of self-teaching myself mathematics and re-learning computer science.

# Plan

**Maths** 

The plan is to make use of the vast amount of free textbooks available on-line to reach my goal of achieving the level of a first-year undergraduate mathematics student.  Initially I hope to spend around ten hours a week on this project, though this amount may change over time.  I have no time-specific goals for this project as I have no idea of how long it will take to learn the subjects I wish to study.

Currently the initial topics I plan on starting with are *Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry*, followed by *Calculus*, then *Discrete Maths* based topics.  This is to get myself to the level I believe I would have had pre-university.  Once I am confident in these I will find an undergraduate course guide and follow as best I can with the free resources available.

**Computer Science**

Once I have the rudimentary math skills mentioned above I will follow the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science?tab=readme-ov-file#summary) Computer Science curriculum.

# Outcome

It is my hope that within two years I will be at a level where I will feel confident enough in my skills to apply for development jobs.
