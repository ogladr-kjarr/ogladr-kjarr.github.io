# The Odin Project: Foundations

I completed the foundations course of The Odin Project. Overall I was happy with the course, I think the technical level for a beginners course was fair, and the projects challenging enough to implement what was learned.

# Books

**Intermediate Algebra - OpenStax**

I completed chapters six to eight. While there is some overlap with the previous algebra book a lot of it is new and so I am taking my time working through all the example questions and practise tests.

# Next Steps

This week I will start The Odin Project Full Stack course using Javascript rather than the Ruby course. I also hope to finish the Intermediate Algebra book.
